OOSTethys is an open source collaborative project that seeks to create and adapt tools to help developing observing system components. Observing system components span form sensor interfaces to catalogs of services. OOSTethys team seeks the best standards available and creates easy to adopt toolkits. The toolkits:

  * Dramatically reduce the time service providers spend installing, adopting and keeping up to date new technologies and standard services.
  * Increase interoperability since the toolkits are standard reference implementation and rely on the best practices of the community.
