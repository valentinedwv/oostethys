# Welcome #

OOSTethys is a community of software developers and marine scientists who develop open source tools to integrate observing systems. We host our code here in Google code.

Our goal is to dramatically reduce the time it takes to install, adopt and update standards-compliant Web services for observing systems.

We are developing applications that support the [OGC Sensor Web Enablement](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sensorweb). Currently we have implementations that help you get an OGC Sensor Observation Service installed easily and quickly on a web server. The following are available:

  * [PERL for ASCII and RDBMS sources](PERLServerInstall.md)
  * [JAVA for OPeNDAP / NetCDF sources](JavaServerMain.md)
  * [PYTHON for RDBMS sources](https://code.google.com/p/oostethys/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fcomponent%2Fserver%2Fpython%2FPySOS)
  * [ASP](ASPServerInstall.md)

If you want to start a new SOS implementation in another language or develop an implementation from another source (e.g. JAVA RDBMS), or any other idea that could advance the integration of observing systems in a standards complaint way, join our team here: http://groups.google.com/group/oostethys_dev.  As a developer you can also help debugging,  adding functionality to existing branches and test current reference implementation. Let us know !
